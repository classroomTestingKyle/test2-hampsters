# Using Github Classroom to set up your Team Story Assignments Repository

[Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) allows teachers to create individual assignments and group assignments that can be given to teams of students, to work on them in private or public repositories (in our case: private).

In this short guide I use the major two story assignments for the semester as the example case to show you how to set up the team repository. In less than five minutes you will have a private repository for your team's stories, reporting memos, data, methodology notes, drafts and final stories. You will file the required story assignments to your instructors by putting everything in your team repository.

## 1. Get the team repository link and sign in Github

You will receive a link (something like `http://classroom.github.com/group-assignment-invitations/something`) in an email from your instructor to create your team repository. After you click on the link, the Github page will ask you to sign up for an account or sign in to your existing account.

## 2. Create your team

The next screen will ask you to accept the assignment, in this case "storiesrepo".

Create a new team by adding a team name (environment, for example) and click on +Create team.

If you see that other teams show up in this screen, check if one of those includes your team member. That means she/he already created the team and click on it to join the team. If not, don´t pay attention to them. Those are the repositories that other class teams have created already.

## 4. Get cracking! Work on your team repository now  :fist: :pencil:

Welcome to your team repository for the two stories you will work on during this semester. Remember to check the class introductory guide to Github and Markdown´s [short guide.](https://github.com/datajournalists/djspring17/blob/master/markdownforjournalists.md) If your teammate is not yet in the repository you can add they or tell they to join by clicking on the link sent by the instructor and choosing your team.

In this repository you will write the reporting memos, drafts, include details in the methodology files about how you worked with the data for each story and add the data you used in the data folder included in each story folder.  

Your instructors will be added automatically to the repository and will be able to watch your assignment progress.
