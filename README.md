## Course Description

Journalists live and get paid to find the truth, serve their communities and hold the powerful accountable. Today, fortunately, journalists have access to more data than ever before, as well as better tools to understand that data, expose the stories buried in the numbers, deal with troves of documents and combine this techniques with traditional serious reporting. From Phillip Meyer’s exposes in Detroit using statistical and surveying techniques to the global story of the Panama Papers, Data Journalism has proven it’s value as a powerful way to foster positive change in modern society.

Data are everywhere. In public sources, like election results, budgets and census reports: semi public and private data sets like hidden company information; in cross referencing documents and databases to discover conflicts of interest and corruption, to social media like Facebook, Twitter updates, and image and video uploads. Journalists need to know how to find stories in data and shape them in compelling ways.

In this hands-on course you will learn to gather, clean, structure and analyze data, use statistical methods to find relevant insights and bullet proof your work to produce two data-driven stories that may be of relevance to our community.

While you learn to use different software and improve your data skills in our lab sessions, the driving theme of this course will be to do Journalism in the public interest.
Students will have individual lab assignments and will work in teams of two for the two semester stories, focused on original reporting about a public policy, an agency or government authority. Each team will pitch four stories and the instructors will choose two that they will report on during the entire semester. **You will choose a Topic Beat. And you will OWN it** **for the entire semester.** In the same way [ProPublica defined its strategic reporting beats for the years to come](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-is-what-propublica-is-now-covering).

## Objectives and outcomes

This three-credit course explores complex storytelling using data. Students will pitch, report, conceptualize and produce informative compelling data-driven pieces focused on current affairs, public policies or government agencies to hold power accountable. The course emphasizes:

- Learning basic descriptive and inferential statistical methods and concepts, the foundation of solid data reporting

- Conceptualizing clear ways to illustrate trends as part of your analysis and stories

- Data research, collection, organization and edition while maintaining data integrity

- Understanding the development process for creating data stories

- Applying strong traditional reporting techniques with data reporting in a weekly basis to plan and produce high quality data journalism

- Understanding technologies available to work with data to create online, data-driven stories and to a lesser degree data-driven interactive stories

- Using design basics, effective visual communication, and simple data visualization tools for analysis and creation of graphics

- Critical evaluation of professional data stories (what makes a particular project successful?)

- Seeking out innovative uses of data

## Class rules

**Attendance is mandatory.** Data Journalism meets 15 times during the spring semester. It is important that you attend each class. If you’re sick, please let us know via email, Slack or text. If you don’t show up, you will hear from us. More than one excused absence will hurt your grade.

**Communicate.** If you have a problem or if you have difficulties, tell us right away, not after is too late. In journalism that’s what we do. When we have a problem we immediately call our editor.

**Punctuality matters.** Be on time. It shows you are a professional journalist.

**Be accurate.** Always double check everything. Proofread. Ask at least two classmates to review your story before handing it in. When you make mistakes, it hurts your credibility and affects your grade.

**Keep up with the news.** Consuming information on a daily basis leads to a healthy diet of background, helps you connect the dots and discover story ideas to work on, If you care about a topic or your subject concentration you have to stay in top of the game.

**Be a pro.** Honesty, courtesy, curiosity and professionalism are the core values of a journalist. Behave like one because you are a journalist. When classmates are presenting or we have guests or we are working in teams don’t multitask, focus.

**Code of honor.** This class follows the guidelines of the student handbook of our school. More so, in journalism plagiarism or falsification of data, sources and facts are serious crimes that can lead to failing this class. You may also be the subject of suspension, probation or expulsion, pending the decision of the School administration.

## Diversity

It's critical that students learn to include a diverse set of voices in their stories, something that is often glossed over when finding stories in spreadsheets and online sources. You are encouraged and expected to look for stories about and voices from communities that are underrepresented. This also applies to our classroom. Diversity requires us all to discuss differences with respect and empathy, regarding race, gender, age, religion, gender, sexual preference, disability, language or origin.

## Assignments and Due Dates

*Note:* For the first 3 weeks you will file your assignments via email to [miguel.paz@journalism.cuny.edu](mailto:miguel.paz@journalism.cuny.edu) and [ryan.mcneill@journalism.cuny.edu](mailto:ryan.mcneill@journalism.cuny.edu).

*After Week 3 you will file your assignments using the Class Github repository. The link and instructions will be informed to you in Week 3.*

The class assignments are composed by: topic beat pre-reporting and pitch of 4 story ideas for 2 story projects (5%), class participation, class work and readings (15%), homework data exercises (15%), story project 1 (30%) and story project 2 (35%).

### Topic beat pre-reporting and pitch of 4 story ideas (5%)

In the first class we will organize in teams of two people (5 teams). Each team will choose a topic beat and hand in a reporting memo via email about it before the 2nd class. Include as much relevant information you can gather about the topic. The idea is that you become as close to an expert as you can. In the 2nd class each team summarizes findings.

In 3rd class each team pitches four story ideas. The Instructors will choose two story ideas per team. You will work on them for the entire semester and we will pick together which one you will do first and which second (by the time you hand in the 1st story we revisit the value of the 2nd story and see if it’s still feasible or you can propose a new one).

**Pitch requirements:**

You must pitch 4 story ideas in 1 single document. Each story pitch should be 1 page long, 2 pages long max.

For each story describe it in detail (1 page, 2 max. per story) by answering the following questions:

- Team byline and beat.

- What is your story about? Tell us in 1 headline and 1 lead paragraph.

- What is the single question your story tries to answer?

- Why this story is relevant ("So what?) and why now?

- Why will this story resonate with our audience?

- What else has been done on this topic? (Provide links) and how is your angle different or fresh?    

- List in bullets the unique investigative findings your story will reveal

- What are the potential main characters and scenes?    

- What documents/data/audio have you already gathered?

- List of human sources and if you have approached them already

- Maximum/minimum.

  - What is the maximum (best) story possible?

  - What’s the minimum (fallback) story if your hypothesis doesn’t prove out?

- Extra: Other questions that you can answer in a sentence: What other question is your story trying to answer? How will this story hold someone accountable? Does this story have potential to drive change?

Repeat the process for each story pitch. Keep it all in 1 document.

**Deadline:** Wednesday February 22 at 12 pm. You will file the pitches by sharing the link to your Pitches Google Doc via email to your Instructors. Make sure you share the document with permission to edit so we can add comments and suggest changes.

### Class participation, class work, readings (15%)

Your participation and professionalism includes attending all classes, arriving on time, returning from breaks on time, being active in discussions about readings (see list of Readings), giving feedback to your peers, and participating in all in-class hands-on activities. Repeated absences or tardiness will result in a reduction in your grade.

### Deadlines

Deadlines matter. Please carefully note these rule: for every 24 hours that passes after a deadline in which you still have not turned in part of a project, an additional 10 percent deduction applies to it.

There will be no extensions except in cases of medical emergency, family emergency, or zombie invasion. Make-up work will not be offered except in extenuating circumstances.

### Assignment Scale

Final grades in the course correspond to the grading scale used in the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. Here is the minimum percentage of each letter grade:

- 97: A+  Stellar work. Ready to be published by a professional news organization with minimal changes.
- 93: A Excellent work. It is ready to be published professionally with some changes.
- 90: A- Good quality work, although it needs a slightly more significant revision to be able to be published.
- 87: B+ Solid work that shows some deficiencies that need to be solved.
- 83: B Meets certain requirements, but lacks several important elements.
- 80: B- Below average and needs strong overall improvements.
- 77: C+ Poor job. It presents many problems of structure, reporting and storytelling
- 73: C Almost unacceptable because of major overall problems.
- 70: C- Unacceptable. Does not meet the minimum requirements of a graduate level journalism project.
- Anything below a 70 is an F. Work has failed at every level. There is no D in CUNY’s grading scale.

### Assignment Values

Each assignment represents a percentage of your final grade and has points that adds up to 100 points, which equals the highest score for the assignment. The points you earn, for the different elements of the assignment, directly results in your assignment grade.

Example: Story project 1 is 30% of your final grade. On a point scale your reporting memo 1 is 10 points, the reporting memo 2 is 15 points, your story draft is 25 points and your final story is 50 points. That’s a total of 100 points. If you get 97 to 100 points in total you will have an A+ for that assignment. To determine your assignment grade, simply add up all the points you have earned for each sub-assignment.

## Grading Rubric

### For all Assignments

In assessing students' work, the instructor will focus on the following factors applicable to all assignments (specific criteria for each assignment will be detailed later):

* Process: Were the drafts iterated and improved based on faculty feedback?

* Quality and Shine: Is it executed with skill and subtlety, and has it been edited well and polished?

* Organization and Presentation: Is it presented clearly and in a professional manner suitable for an audience?

* Effort and Application: Has the work been prepared with careful thought and attention to detail, and does it take appropriate advantage of the relevant tools?

* Punctuality and Completeness: Is it on time and complete, and does it fulfill the assignment?

### For Discussions

* Preparedness: Has the student completed the work necessary in preparation for the discussion (viewing assigned video, completing assigned reading or tutorial)?

* Participation: Was the student engaged in the discussion (both paying attention and participating)?

### For In-class Exercises

* Effort: Did the student try to complete the exercise to better understand the lesson at hand?

* Participation: If the exercise involves collaboration, did the student contribute?

## Capstone and extra credit

**Capstone:** Students who wish to incorporate material from the class into a capstone project may be able to make special arrangements.

**Extra credit:** One of the instructors (Miguel) maintains a Medium publication called [Notes from the Classroom](https://medium.com/notes-from-the-classroom), where he and interested students write about tools, lessons, short tutorials and class work. If you write one or more posts about how you used data, specific tools and methodologies to produce one of your class stories you get extra credit. This extra credit will increase by 10% to 20% your class participation, class work and readings grade, depending on the quality and detail of the post. If you and your team members write a post, you must tell me what each one did in the project and in the written post.
