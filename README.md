**Website**: https://datajournalists.github.io/djspring17/

<!-- In here I will add the Syllabus and other relevant materials. Beware: everything in this repository is publicly available. That means that your homework exercises, comments and professor feedback will live in the open. For your reporting projects you will be asked to create a team repository and invite your professors to it. Your reporting memos, updates and questions regarding reporting projects will live in YOUR team repository (one that you have to create and keep private while you are reporting).
-->


### Stuff about GitHub Pages that I will delete.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/datajournalists/djspring17/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


### Jekyll Theme Used: Dinky

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/datajournalists/djspring17/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
